# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
    - Version control is a way of recording changes to files that you can revisit later. It is very useful because it helps you to keep your edits organized and separate from your master branch, that way any bugs are not introduced. In working and editing outside your master branch, you can make mistakes or revert back to previous edits that are unaffecting to your master branch.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
    - A branch is a copy of your master branch code that you can revise separately. You edit the copy code so that it won't compromise your master branch. Once you are satisfied with your branch code, you can then merge it to your master branch. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
    - A commit is telling your computer to create a save point on that file and code that you can revert back to if necessary. A good commit message is one that clearly states the reason for the edit. 
* What is a merge conflict?
    - A merge conflict is when you are trying to merge two branches that have the same region of a file modified, and contain different information. Git does not know which version it should use, therefore a conflict is created which you must resolve.
