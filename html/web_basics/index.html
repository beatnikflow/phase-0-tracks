    <h1> All About Sloths! </h1>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sloths are tropical mammals that live in Central and South America.</li>
          <li>They use their long claws to hang onto branches while they feast on leaves.</li>
          <li>Their long claws â€” 3 to 4 inches make walking on the ground difficult, so they spend most of their time in the tall trees they call home.</li>
          <li>There are two categories of sloths. The two-toed sloth is slightly bigger than the three-toed sloth, though they share many of the same features.</li>
          <li>A sloth's life revolves around sleeping and eating in their tree homes. The only times these mammals leave their tree is to use the bathroom and to take a swim.</li>
          <li>Sloths in captivity sleep from 15 to 20 hours per day. Sloths in the wild, though, sleep about as much as humans.</li>
          <li>Sloths are excellent swimmers. To get to the rivers for a swim, sloths will drop themselves off of branches into the water.</li>
