        <p><h1>*** Sloth Facts ***</h1>
          <ul>
            <li>Sloths are tropical mammals that live in Central and South America.</li>
            <li>They use their long claws to hang onto branches while they feast on leaves.</li>
            <li>Their long claws â€” <strong>3 to 4 inches</strong>, make walking on the ground difficult, so they spend most of their time in the tall trees they call home.</li>
            <li>There are two categories of sloths. The <strong>two-toed sloth</strong> is slightly bigger than the <strong>three-toed sloth.</strong></li>
            <li>A sloth's life revolves around sleeping and eating in their tree homes. The only times these mammals leave their tree is to use the bathroom and to take a swim.</li>
            <li>Sloths in captivity sleep from <strong> 15 to 20 hours per day.</strong> Sloths in the wild, though, sleep about as much as humans.</li>
            <li>Sloths are excellent swimmers. To get to the rivers for a swim, sloths will drop themselves off of branches into the water.</li>
        </ul>
