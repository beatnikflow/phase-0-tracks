    <h1> All About Sloths! </h1>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sloths are tropical mammals that live in Central and South America.</li>
          <li>They use their long claws to hang onto branches while they feast on leaves.</li>
          <li>Their long claws â€” 3 to 4 inches make walking on the ground difficult, so they spend most of their time in the tall trees they call home.</li>
